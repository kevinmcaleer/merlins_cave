## Welcome to Merlins Cave
You start the game at the entrance to a cave, Merlins Cave.

This is based on the classic text adventure games and is playable on any MicroPython device via the REPL.

There are two files:
- `merlins_cave.py` - this is the main game
- `rooms.py` - this contains all the details of each room
